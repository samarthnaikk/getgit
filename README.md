What GetGit Is
GetGit is a Python command-line tool that analyzes GitHub repositories and answers natural language questions about them. By combining GitHub’s REST API with query pattern matching, it lets users explore repositories without manually browsing files, READMEs, or metadata.
At its core, it acts as a repository intelligence layer on top of GitHub.
